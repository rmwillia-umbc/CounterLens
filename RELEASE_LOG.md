# CounterLens Release Log - V2.2

## [V2.3.1] - 2026-03-04
### Fixed
- **Animate Scrollbar**: Resolved an unsightly scrollbar issue caused by the `animate-fate-flip` effect by optimizing the layout flow.
- **Micro-Polish**: Added a subtle "breathing" animation effect to the Result Indicators for more dynamic feedback.

## [V2.3] - 2026-03-04
### Added
- **UI Height Synchronization**: Perfectly aligned the heights across different panels (Counterfactual Visualizer, Counterfactual Editor, Dataset Slices, Confusion Matrix) for a cleaner, unified scientific grid.
- **Score Stability Visualization**: The Counterfactual Editor now displays both the original and updated decision margin values, providing a clear delta of the algorithmic impact.
- **Enhanced Label Contrast**: Increased visibility for secondary gray text labels (e.g., gender and score categories) within the Dataset Slices for better legibility on high-density displays.

### Changed
- **Default Visual Focus**: Set GPA as the default X-axis for the Counterfactual Visualizer to streamline common analytical workflows.
- **Scientific Aesthetic**: Refined the spacing and contrast of the Data Slices module to match the "Aurora Terminal" design language.

## [V2.2] - 2026-02-26
### Added
- **Mathematics-Style Axis Labeling**: GPA and SAT labels are now directly embedded at the ends of the axes for a more rigorous academic look.
- **Physical Truncation Marks**: Added double-slash marks at the origin to denote non-zero starting points (GPA 2.5, SAT 1200), improving scientific accuracy.
- **Unified Tactile DNA**: Applied `btn-tactile` (chamfered corners) to the Decision Margin module for full system UI consistency.

### Changed
- **Coordinate System Optimization**: Adjusted default viewing ranges to GPA [2.5-4.0] and SAT [1200-1600] to reduce whitespace and increase data density.
- **Dashboard Rebalancing**: 
    - Updated grid proportions to a symmetrical **20% : 60% : 20%** for better visual stability.
    - Expanded central Counterfactual Visualizer to 60% width.
- **Micro-UX Polish**:
    - Unified all help buttons (HelpCircle) to match adjacent font sizes.
    - Shortened Lab Guide and Ethics Scanner to `h-24` and synchronized their internal vertical alignment.
    - Reduced font sizes in the Result Indicator for a more compact, data-dense look.
    - Minimized vertical spacing between feature sliders and their labels.

### Fixed
- **Modal Congestion**: Removed redundant 'X' close buttons in favor of 'OK' buttons and compressed top padding for a tighter UI.
- **Visual Overlap**: Resolved clipping issues for GPA/SAT axis labels by adjusting chart margins.
- **Geometric Inconsistency**: Fixed the Decision Margin container's "pill" shape, reverting it to consistent chamfered corners.
